Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
In this task, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a population dataset, with a focus on creating visualizations that illustrate the distribution of both categorical and continuous variables. The goal was to uncover meaningful patterns and trends within the data through effective data preprocessing and visualization techniques.



## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is <a href="https://github.com/rutujaparab20/PRODIGY_DS_1./blob/main/worldpopulationdata.csv">world_population_dataset</a>. This dataset contains records of population from the year 2001 to 2022. 

## Tools and Libraries used
- Jupyter notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization



## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

2. **Visualization**: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. 



## Conclusion

Through this task, I gained hands-on experience with real-world data by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global population trends. The process involved data cleaning, understanding the dataset's structure, and visualizing patterns to derive meaningful insights.

The visualizations effectively highlighted population changes across different years and countries, offering valuable perspectives on global growth dynamics. This task not only enhanced my data analysis and visualization skills but also laid a strong foundation for future data science and machine learning projects.



Thank you for reviewing my submission!
